/**
 * Tags this mod <em>reads</em>, as opposed to the ones it only declares itself into.
 *
 * <p>{@link #KINETIC_ENERGY_STORAGE} is a cross-mod convention rather than this mod's property, and
 * it is in the {@code c} namespace for that reason: nobody owns it, so a second addon adds its own
 * block without depending on this one, and a pack author can add a third mod's block with a datapack
 * and fix an interaction neither author has heard of. That last property is the whole point — the
 * alternative designs (a shared API artifact, a NeoForge capability) both need a common class on the
 * classpath, and neither can be patched in from outside.
 *
 * <p><b>What membership means:</b> the capacity this block supplies to a kinetic network is drawn
 * from a store it filled earlier, not generated. Tag the block that is the <em>kinetic source</em>,
 * which for a multiblock is not necessarily the one a player thinks of as the storage.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not need to say:</b> how much, or whether it is doing it right now. Create
 * already answers both — {@code KineticNetwork#getActualCapacityOf} multiplies the recorded
 * contribution by {@code getGeneratedSpeed()}, which is zero for a store that is not currently
 * spending. That is why one boolean per block is a sufficient contract, and why this is a tag rather
 * than an interface.

	 * <p><b>A tag, and a default-allow one, because Create does not model this and stress cannot stand
	 * in for it.</b> The obvious test is "does it draw stress", and it is wrong: {@code belt} is
	 * registered {@code setNoImpact}, and so are {@code gantry_shaft}, {@code flywheel} and
	 * {@code display_board}. A belt network is the canonical Create load and draws exactly zero, so a
	 * battery keyed on stress would have refused to carry the most ordinary base there is — while still
	 * spinning up for a bare shaft, which also draws zero. Stress separates *big* loads from small ones,
	 * not loads from plumbing.
	 *
	 * <p>So membership is listed rather than derived, and the default is the safe direction: anything
	 * <em>not</em> in here counts as worth driving. A block this mod has never heard of gets driven,
	 * which is how it behaved before; only the handful of blocks known to do nothing but relay are
	 * excluded. A pack or another addon adds its own relay with a datapack.
