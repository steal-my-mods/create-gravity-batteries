/**
 * Tags this mod <em>reads</em>, as opposed to the ones it only declares itself into.
 *
 * <p>{@link #KINETIC_ENERGY_STORAGE} is a cross-mod convention rather than this mod's property, and
 * it is in the {@code c} namespace for that reason: nobody owns it, so a second addon adds its own
 * block without depending on this one, and a pack author can add a third mod's block with a datapack
 * and fix an interaction neither author has heard of. That last property is the whole point — the
 * alternative designs (a shared API artifact, a NeoForge capability) both need a common class on the
 * classpath, and neither can be patched in from outside.
 *
 * <p><b>What membership means:</b> the capacity this block supplies to a kinetic network is drawn
 * from a store it filled earlier, not generated. Tag the block that is the <em>kinetic source</em>,
 * which for a multiblock is not necessarily the one a player thinks of as the storage.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not need to say:</b> how much, or whether it is doing it right now. Create
 * already answers both — {@code KineticNetwork#getActualCapacityOf} multiplies the recorded
 * contribution by {@code getGeneratedSpeed()}, which is zero for a store that is not currently
 * spending. That is why one boolean per block is a sufficient contract, and why this is a tag rather
 * than an interface.
